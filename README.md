## Distributed Systems Lab - Compare Datacenter Scheduling Policies

The original README for OpenDC which includes an overview of the architecture as well as how to set it up and more details can be found [here](original_readme.md).

### Branching policy

The `main` branch is used for the work that is done in the context of this project. It is based on the master branch of the official OpenDC repository. As such it should be suitable for merging into it, if/once the need arises to do so. However, before doing so, it should be checked which files have been created/modified in order to make the work of implementing & testing different allocation policies possible before attempting to do a merge with the official OpenDC `master` branch, as some files maybe be irrelevant for pushing changes back upstream.

The `old-master` is a copy of the original `master` branch and is kept as a reference.
